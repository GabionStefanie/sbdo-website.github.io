              Root canal treatment, also known as endodontic therapy, is a
              dental procedure designed to treat infection or damage to the
              pulp (the innermost soft tissue) of a tooth. The pulp contains
              nerves, blood vessels, and connective tissue. When the pulp
              becomes infected or inflamed, a root canal is performed to
              remove the damaged tissue and save the tooth.
              <br />
              <br />
              Root canal treatment is performed to save a natural tooth that
              would otherwise need to be extracted due to severe infection or
              damage. By removing the infected pulp and thoroughly cleaning
              the root canals, the dentist prevents the spread of infection to
              surrounding tissues. The procedure alleviates the intense
              toothache associated with infected or inflamed pulp.
              <br />
              <br />
              Root canal treatment is highly successful and is a routine
              dental procedure aimed at saving teeth that might otherwise be
              lost. After the treatment, patients may experience some mild
              discomfort, which can usually be managed with over-the-counter
              pain medication.
