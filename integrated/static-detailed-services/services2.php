            <p class="text">
              A tooth extraction is a dental procedure during which your tooth
              is completely removed from its socket.
              <br />
              <br />
              These can be either simple or complicated extractions.
              <br />
              <br />
              Simple dental extraction involves the removal of teeth that are
              visible in the mouth. These can be carried out without the need
              for an incision or any other special tooth removal techniques.
              <br />
              <br />
              A complicated or most commonly referred to as surgical
              extraction is more complicated than simple dental extraction. it
              involves a tooth that is impacted inside the jaw and cannot be
              removed without making an incision. Surgical dental extraction
              involves the removal of teeth that are not easily accessible
              inside the mouth.

            <li class="list-text">Odontectomy</li>
            <p class="text">
              It is a procedure wherein the dentist will remove the tooth by
              separating and opening the gums, sometimes there is the
              necessity to remove bone around the tooth.
            </p>
            <li class="list-text">Alveolectomy</li>
            <p class="text">
              An alveolectomy is a surgical procedure that removes the
              alveolar bone surrounding an infected tooth. The procedure will
              include reshaping this bone to help prepare for subsequent
              procedures, like implants or a denture fitting.
            </p>
            <li class="list-text">Gingivectomy</li>
            <p class="text">
              It is the surgical removal of gingiva or most commonly known as
              gum tissue. A gingivectomy is necessary when the gums have
              pulled away from the teeth creating deep pockets. The pockets
              make it hard to clean away plaque and calculus.
            </p>
            <li class="list-text">Surgical Root Planing</li>
            <p class="text">
              Root planing is the smoothing of the subgingival root surfaces
              with a curette. The objective of root planing is to remove
              deposits and cementum in an attempt to achieve gingival
              reattachment. Root planing is otherwise known as deep cleaning
              in dentistry. The procedure gets rid of tartar or hardened
              minerals that can stick to your teeth.
            </p>
            <li class="list-text">Crown Lengthening</li>
            <p class="text">
              Crown lengthening is a surgical procedure in which excess gum
              tissue is removed and the gum line is altered in an effort to
              make teeth look longer. This surgical procedure can also be
              achieved orthodontically by extruding the tooth.
