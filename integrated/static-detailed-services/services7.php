              Orthodontics is a specialized branch of dentistry that focuses
              on the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of dental and facial
              irregularities. It is focused on the diagnosis, prevention, and
              treatment of malocclusions (improper bites) and irregularities
              in tooth and jaw alignment. Orthodontic treatment aims to
              enhance both the functional and aesthetic aspects of the oral
              and facial structures.

              Orthodontic treatment is not limited to a specific age group,
              and both children and adults can benefit from orthodontic care.
              The goal is to achieve a healthy, functional, and aesthetically
              pleasing smile.
