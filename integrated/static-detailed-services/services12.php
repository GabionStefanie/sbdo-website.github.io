              Retainers are orthodontic devices used to maintain the position
              of teeth after the completion of orthodontic treatment. They are
              custom-made appliances designed to hold teeth in their corrected
              positions and prevent them from shifting back to their original
              alignment.
              <br />
              <br />
              Retainers are used to maintain keeping your teeth straight
              following completion of your fixed brace therapy. They are
              essential components of orthodontic treatment, playing a
              critical role in ensuring the longevity and stability of the
              corrected tooth positions.
