            <li class="list-text">Expanders</li>
            <p class="text">
              Expanders are orthodontic devices designed to create additional
              space in the mouth by gradually widening the dental arch of your
              lower or upper jaw. These appliances are removable, making them
              different from fixed expanders that are bonded to the teeth.
              Removable expanders are commonly used in orthodontic treatment
              to address issues such as crowding, narrow dental arches, or
              misalignment of the teeth.

            <li class="list-text">Night Guards</li>
            <p class="text">
              Night guards, also known as occlusal splints or bite guards, are
              removable dental appliances designed to be worn during sleep.
              They are typically made of a durable and flexible material, such
              as acrylic, and are custom-fitted to a patient's teeth. Night
              guards are used to address various dental issues related to
              grinding or clenching of the teeth during sleep, a condition
              known as bruxism.
              <br />
              <br />
              Night guards are primarily used to manage the effects of
              bruxism, which includes grinding or clenching of the teeth. This
              condition can lead to tooth wear, jaw pain, headaches, and other
              related symptoms.
            </p>
            <li class="list-text">Retainers</li>
            <p class="text">
              Retainers are orthodontic devices designed to maintain the
              alignment of teeth after orthodontic treatment, such as braces
              or Invisalign. They are custom-made appliances that can be
              removable or fixed (bonded to the teeth), and they play a
              crucial role in preventing teeth from shifting back to their
              original positions.
              <br />
              <br />
              Retainers help preserve the alignment achieved during
              orthodontic treatment, preventing teeth from reverting to their
              previous positions. Teeth have a natural tendency to shift over
              time, and retainers aid in preventing relapse by holding them in
              their corrected positions. In some cases, retainers are used to
              stabilize the relationship between the upper and lower jaws.
              <br />
              <br />
              Retainers are an essential part of the orthodontic process,
              ensuring that the results of orthodontic treatment are
              maintained over the long term.

            <li class="list-text">TMJ Splints</li>
            <p class="text">
              TMJ splints, also known as temporomandibular joint (TMJ) splints
              or occlusal splints, are dental appliances designed to alleviate
              symptoms associated with temporomandibular joint disorders
              (TMD). These splints are custom-fitted devices that are worn in
              the mouth to provide support and promote proper jaw alignment.
              <br />
              <br />
              TMJ splints are often used to alleviate pain and discomfort
              associated with TMD, including jaw pain, headaches, and facial
              pain. For individuals with bruxism (teeth grinding) or clenching
              habits, TMJ splints can help reduce the impact on the jaw joint
              and associated structures. Splints aim to stabilize the
              temporomandibular joint and prevent excessive jaw movement that
              may contribute to TMD symptoms.
