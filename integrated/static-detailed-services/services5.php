              Dentures are removable dental prosthetics designed to replace
              missing teeth and surrounding tissues. They come in two main
              types: complete dentures, which replace all teeth in an arch,
              and partial dentures, which replace only a few missing teeth and
              are attached to the remaining natural teeth.
              <br />
              <br />
              Dental crowns, also known as caps, are prosthetic devices that
              encase or cover a damaged or weakened tooth to restore its
              shape, size, strength, and appearance. Crowns are often made
              from materials like porcelain, ceramic, metal, or a combination
              of these.

            <p class="text">
              Removable dentures are dental prosthetics that can be taken out
              of the mouth by the wearer. They are designed to replace missing
              teeth and surrounding tissues, offering a removable and
              temporary solution for individuals who have lost some or all of
              their natural teeth.
              <br />
              <br />
              Full dentures, also known as complete dentures, are removable
              prosthetic devices that replace all the teeth in one or both
              dental arches (upper or lower). They are made of acrylic or a
              combination of acrylic and metal and are designed to be taken
              out for cleaning and maintenance.
              <br />
              <br />
              Partial dentures are removable prosthetics designed to replace
              one or more missing teeth and are attached to the remaining
              natural teeth. They consist of replacement teeth attached to a
              framework that clasps onto the remaining natural teeth. They can
              be made with a metal or acrylic framework.
              <br />
              <br />
              The specific procedure and adjustments may vary based on the
              type of denture chosen, whether full or partial, and the
              individual patient's needs.

            <li class="list-text">Fixed Partial Dentures</li>
            <p class="text">
              Fixed partial dentures, commonly known as dental bridges, are
              prosthetic devices that are permanently attached to natural
              teeth or dental implants. Unlike removable dentures, fixed
              partial dentures are not meant to be taken out by the wearer.
              <br />
              <br />
              The primary purpose of fixed partial dentures is to replace
              missing teeth, restoring both function and aesthetics. They help
              individuals regain the ability to chew food and speak more
              effectively. By filling the gap left by missing teeth, bridges
              help prevent adjacent natural teeth from shifting out of
              position. Bridges also provide support to facial muscles and can
              help maintain the natural shape of the face.
