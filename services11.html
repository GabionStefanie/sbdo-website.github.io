              <p class="text">
                Tooth sedation, or dental sedation, refers to the use of
                sedative medications to help patients relax or reduce anxiety
                during dental procedures. Sedation is commonly used in dentistry
                to create a more comfortable and stress-free experience,
                particularly for individuals who may have dental phobia or
                anxiety.
                <br />
                <br />
                In emergency dental situations, such as severe tooth pain,
                trauma, or infections, providing prompt and effective care is
                crucial. Sedation may be considered to manage pain, reduce
                anxiety, and facilitate necessary emergency treatments.

              <li class="list-text">Tooth Reimplantation</li>
              <p class="text">
                Tooth reimplantation, also known as dental replantation, is a
                dental procedure where a previously avulsed (knocked-out) tooth
                is reinserted into its socket in the jawbone. This is typically
                done after a traumatic injury or accident has caused the tooth
                to be completely knocked out of its position.
                <br />
                <br />
                Tooth reimplantation is a time-sensitive and delicate procedure
                that requires immediate attention and professional dental care.

              <li class="list-text">Incision and Drainage (I&D)</li>
              <p class="text">
                Incision and Drainage (I&D) is a medical procedure performed to
                treat localized infections or abscesses by creating an incision
                (a small cut) to allow the drainage of pus and infected
                material. This procedure is commonly used to relieve pain,
                promote healing, and prevent the spread of infection to
                surrounding tissues. Incision and Drainage is a common and
                effective procedure for managing localized infections and
                abscesses.
                <br />
                <br />
                Emergency incision and drainage are crucial for addressing acute
                dental infections promptly, providing relief from pain, and
                preventing the spread of infection to other parts of the body.
                Seeking emergency dental care ensures timely intervention and
                appropriate management of dental emergencies.
                <br />
